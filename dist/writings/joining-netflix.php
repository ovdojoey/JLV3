<?php $title="Joining Netflix"; include_once("../partials/writings/writingHeader.php"); ?><h1>Joining Netflix</h1><time>November 10, 2018</time><p>A lot has changed since I last wrote.</p>
<p>In April 2018 I accepted a position at Netflix as a Senior Software UI Engineer. And what a ride it&#39;s been. The caliber
of folks that work here is something I have never seen before – everyone is a rockstar.</p>
<p>Working in a fast paced, high performing culture has its ups and downs. It is no secret that you must quickly become a needle-mover for the business.
High impact is a matter of fact, a necessity for continued employment. There just isn&#39;t room for mediocrity.
This shouldn&#39;t scare you, though; the stakes are communicated well before you interview.</p>
<p>I mentioned there were upsides too – many of them. With high performance comes growth, stimulation, challenge, and opportunity.
What could be better than the chance to impact a hundred million people through your work? Netflix employees do not suffer from workplace woes like boredom or complacency.
We thrive in uncertainty and see obstacles as a challenge to be solved.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to work here. I am grateful that both my technical and non-technical skills have grown exponentially in a short 7 months.
My new job checklist was short – money, stimulation, and growth; Netflix generously checks all three.</p>
<p>The stakes are high but the reward is sweet.</p>
