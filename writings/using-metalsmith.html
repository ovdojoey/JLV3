**UPDATE** I still enjoy Metalsmith.  But, as of right now it's not part of my build.
I've achived the same functionality using my own doloop npm module.

  Building this website was my first time using Metalsmith, and I must say... I really like it!
  I think there are a few things that I need to improve in my flow
  (like the file watchers -- currently I have to stop Node and restart to rebuild when a collection template or post changes; all other file changes are watched and rebuilt properly).

  There has been a few headaches though, namely Metalsmith Collections and working with the underlying data that gets created.  But, for the most part it's been a fun and smooth web building experience and it's helped me get better at tooling and project workflow.
  My existing workflow was a simple gulpfile, and while this is similar, I believe Metalsmith is much more versatile and useful.

  I especially love the fact that I can add a simple HTML file that is tagged as a blog post or portfolio post, and the site rebuilds and takes care of itself to link assets together.

  I hope to be making another blog post about using Metalsmith with more in-depth techincal discussions.  Stay tuned.
