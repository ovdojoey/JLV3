I'll admit. This concept is probably
such a simple one that I shouldn't even be writing about it.  But,
 I've fallen trap to this misconception many times &mdash; alas here I am
typing.

So heres the problem...

Say you have `y` which is the year, and you want to know what year next year is.

One may think to be terse and write:

    var newYear = y++;

Or perhaps only I am silly enough to write such things.  Either way, you can probably
spot the problem.

Both `newYear` and `y` are equal to `y + 1`.

That makes for tricky use of `y` later on.
