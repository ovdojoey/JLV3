<p class="home-tagline">You may&nbsp;have heard the phrase “build it and they will come.” &nbsp;But how&nbsp;true is that&nbsp;mindset? &nbsp;In my experience as a&nbsp;web&nbsp;developer,&nbsp;<em>building the project</em>&nbsp;is only one very small part of the equation. &nbsp;A realistic approach looks more like this: plan it, share it, get feedback, wireframe it, start building it, test it, fix it, test again, advertise it, get more&nbsp;feedback, create social buzz, engage users, test again, fix, and if all is going well, <em>keep building.</em></p>
<p class="home-tagline">While the catchline worked in the&nbsp;Hollywood movie&nbsp;<em>Field of Dreams,&nbsp;</em>in real life applications it is not so cut and dry. &nbsp;For start-ups and internet companies, <em>you should not solely focus on building</em> the&nbsp;project and <em>instead focus on the user experience your project will create</em>. &nbsp;Think about how the end&nbsp;user will benefit from your website or application? &nbsp;If you are struggling to see the benefits, it is a pretty good chance others may&nbsp;not find the value either.</p>
<p class="home-tagline"><strong>How do I improve value?</strong></p>
<p class="home-tagline" style="padding-left: 30px;">1. <em>Find out what</em>&nbsp;<em>the user wants and how you can&nbsp;provide it to them.</em>&nbsp; Is your&nbsp;website&nbsp;going to solve a problem for the user, save them time or money, bring them joy, provide them information, perform a task, etc? &nbsp;Each project will be unique in how the user will benefit, but <em>every successful website or application provides a clear benefit to the end-user.</em></p>
<p class="home-tagline" style="padding-left: 30px;">2. <i>Research, research, research. &nbsp;</i>Are you entering into a market that is already saturated? &nbsp;Do you have competitors? &nbsp;What are your&nbsp;buzzwords / keywords?&nbsp;What will your upfront costs be? &nbsp;<em>Write out your business plan and detail your objectives and perceived obstacles before you start building.</em></p>
<p class="home-tagline" style="padding-left: 30px;">3. <i>Start small, stay small and work quick. &nbsp;</i>It should not take years and years to launch. &nbsp;The best approach is to start small, launch quickly, get feedback and improve your existing features before expanding and bloating.</p>
<p class="home-tagline" style="padding-left: 30px;">4. <i>Learn from the success (and failures) of others.</i>&nbsp;Find out what successful companies&nbsp;are doing and learn from their approaches. &nbsp;Borrow some of the tricks and tips they use, and&nbsp;engage your own&nbsp;customers.</p>
<p class="home-tagline" style="padding-left: 30px;">5.&nbsp;<em>Improve. &nbsp;</em>There is&nbsp;one quote you can count on: that&nbsp;<em>practice makes perfect</em>. &nbsp;The more you work, the better you become. &nbsp;Your first iteration may look nothing like your last, but I&nbsp;can bet that it&nbsp;improved.</p>
<p class="home-tagline" style="padding-left: 30px;">6.&nbsp;<em>Don’t give up.&nbsp;</em>You won’t get it right the first time, or the second time… Maybe not even the 1,000 time, but if you keep&nbsp;<em>improving</em> and&nbsp;<em>learning along the way, </em>your&nbsp;failures will have laid the foundation to your next success.</p>
<p class="home-tagline" style="padding-left: 30px;">7.&nbsp;<em>Recognize failure. &nbsp;</em>Not every project&nbsp;is destined for success. &nbsp;Some projects need to be shelved to make time for new ones. &nbsp;Recognizing failure is not the same as giving up, it is merely adjusting your mindset and allowing yourself to move&nbsp;on to a more viable, successful&nbsp;endeavor.</p>
<p class="home-tagline">After finishing&nbsp;many of my projects, I found&nbsp;myself&nbsp;discouraged because no one came to look at my work. &nbsp;I spent so many hours coding that I never thought about how the user would see my project and benefit from it.</p>
<p class="home-tagline">I am still learning and finding my own&nbsp;path to&nbsp;success,&nbsp;but&nbsp;I hope that these tips help you in your journey.</p>
