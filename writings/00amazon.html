I'm sorry. I haven't posted in quite some time... You see,  I made this website
and planned to fill it with cool stories and life events, but I never did.

Time to change that.

So, here's the inside scoop:

Just over a year ago, I accepted a position at Amazon.

I've met some of the best and brightest and learned a ton along the way. I get to interview the future engineers of Amazon,
influence the roadmap of our org, work on some (mostly) sweet projects, and really demonstrate
the leadership principles they talk about from Day One.  It's been an amazing journey.

I don't know what the future holds, but I do feel very lucky to have made an impact at the company thus far.
