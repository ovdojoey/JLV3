So, I've run into a small flub disgused as learning experience.
I was writing up a short post about using
<a href="/writings/plus-plus.php">the increment operator</a>
and I learned something new.

The increment and decrement operators in JS (and many other langauges) have two styles of
functioning, either as `postfix` or `prefix`.

If you are like me, you are probably most familar with the postfix style, or
writing your increment as `i++`.  It's likely you are
not using the value returned from this function, rather it's probably in a loop.

But, for giggles, lets say you need to know right away what `i++` is.

    var i = 0; console.log(i++);

So, what gets logged? You may think 1, but due to the way postfix works,
you'll actually see `0`.

The function returns `i` before the increment takes place.
That means if you write  `var plus = i++` and expect to have `plus` equal `i + 1` you'll be in
for a whirl.  Thus, prefix and postfix operators come in to play.

## Prefix
`++i` returns the incremented value right away.  This allows you to reference
the incremented value before using `i` later on in the script, like so:

    var i = 2016;
    var newYear = ++i;
    console.log('Next year is ' + newYear + '. The year after is ' + ++i);

## Postfix
Unlike prefix, the variable value is returned before the operation takes place.
